# Zynq Feather r0.2 16.04.2021
This is the second revision of the Zynq-Feather project. This project is currently still under development. It is not recommended to copy the project in this release state.

Things that are on the ToDo list:
-	Layerstack: (The current layerstack is not optimized and ready for production. The prototypes were produced with a default pool layerstack without impedance control. Due to the short trace lengths this works for prototypes but isnÂ´t recommended)
-	board-board interface: Will be re-routed to support the zynq RGMII Interface.
-	USB current limit: The USB current limit can be bypassed with a MOSFET controlled by the FPGA. This will be reworked in future revisions
-	PCB Designrules: The current PCB Fab designrules required by the layout are 80um trace clearance and thickness. This will be reworked (if possible) in future revisions.
